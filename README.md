# VocaVision 🎙️👁️

**AI-Based Color, Clothing and Food Recognition Assistive System**

A vision-based assistive system that identifies **clothing colors/patterns** and **food items** and describes them through **voice output** to support independent daily activities.

> **All recognition runs locally using custom-trained neural networks. No external API or internet connection required.**

## Architecture

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Food Classifier | MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning) | Identifies 10 food categories |
| Clothing Classifier | Custom CNN (trained from scratch) | Identifies 10 clothing categories |
| Color Detector | OpenCV + K-Means Clustering | Detects dominant clothing colors |
| Voice Output | pyttsx3 (offline TTS) | Speaks descriptions aloud |
| Camera | OpenCV (webcam) | Captures live video feed |

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the models

**Clothing Classifier** (~30 MB download, ~10–20 min training):
```bash
python training/train_clothing.py
```

**Food Classifier** (~4.6 GB download first time, ~30–60 min training):
```bash
python training/train_food.py
```

### 3. Evaluate (optional)
```bash
python training/evaluate.py
```
This generates confusion matrix plots in `models/`.

### 4. Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```

A webcam window will open. Point it at **clothing or food** and:
- Press **`Space`** → AI analyzes and speaks the description
- Press **`Q`** → Quit
